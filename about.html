                Hi everyone by reading this page you can understand all about <span class="GameName">Find The Assassin</span>.<br>I've updated it once, so it's currently version 1.1! <br>
                The game is still in development because it's a multiplayer game inspired by *Among Us*, and I update it once a week - sometimes even two or three times a week. <br>
                Its name is <span class="GameName"> Find The Assassin</span>. You can play it with friends or with strangers, and it's suitable for all ages - thereâ€™s no violence, blood, or anything inappropriate. <br>
                I really hope you'll enjoy playing my game! <br> 
                </span>
            </p>
